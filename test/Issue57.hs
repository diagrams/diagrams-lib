{- From bug report by Felipe Lessa (Issue #57):

Hello!

I'm sorry that I didn't do my homework to investigate the "why", but I've included a very simple test case.  You may compile and run the test as follows:

$ ghc -O --make -fforce-recomp -rtsopts bug.hs
$ ./bug -o t.png --selection=??? +RTS -s

where ??? may be "hcat", "foldl1", "foldr1" or "foldTree".  The program just concatenates 1,000 (rect 1 1)s.  On my computer, I get the following:

hcat: 23s, 130 MiB
foldr1: 30s, 69 MiB
foldl1: 27s, 62 MiB
foldTree: 1s, 7 MiB

Concatenating one thousand unit squares shouldn't take more than 20 seconds =).  This is a showstopper for me, so I've reimplemented hcat (see hcatB at the end of [1])
