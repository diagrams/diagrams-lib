--  TrailLike class
------------------------------------------------------------

-- | A type class for trail-like things, /i.e./ things which can be
--   constructed from a concretely located 'Trail'.  Instances include
--   lines, loops, trails, paths, lists of vertices, two-dimensional
--   'Diagram's, and 'Located' variants of all the above.
--
--   Usually, type variables with 'TrailLike' constraints are used as
--   the /output/ types of functions, like
--
--   @
--   foo :: (TrailLike t) => ... -> t
--   @
--
--   Functions with such a type can be used to construct trails,
--   paths, diagrams, lists of points, and so on, depending on the
--   context.
--
--   To write a function with a signature like the above, you can of
--   course call 'trailLike' directly; more typically, one would use
--   one of the provided functions like 'fromOffsets', 'fromVertices',
--   'fromSegments', or '~~'.

--   is ignored.

-- | 'Trail's are trail-like; the location is simply ignored.

--   underlying type is.
instance TrailLike t => TrailLike (TransInv t) where
