-- This module defines /trails/, translationally invariant paths
-- through space.  Trails form a central part of the diagrams-lib API,
-- so the documentation for this module merits careful study.
--
-- Related modules include:
--
-- * The 'TrailLike' class ("Diagrams.TrailLike") exposes a generic
--   API for building a wide range of things out of trails.
--
-- * 'Path's ("Diagrams.Path") are collections of 'Located'
--   ("Diagrams.Located") trails.
--
-- * Trails are composed of 'Segment's (see "Diagrams.Segment"),
--   though most users should not need to work with segments directly.

-- The Trail' type

-- XXX add some pictures?

-- | Intuitively, a trail is a single, continuous path through space.
--   However, a trail has no fixed starting point; it merely specifies
--   /how/ to move through space, not /where/.  For example, \"take
--   three steps forward, then turn right twenty degrees and take two
--   more steps\" is an intuitive analog of a trail; these
--   instructions specify a path through space from any given starting
--   location.  To be precise, trails are /translation-invariant/;
--   applying a translation to a trail has no effect.
--
--   A @'Located' Trail@, on the other hand, is a trail paired with
--   some concrete starting location (\"start at the big tree on the
--   corner, then take three steps forward, ...\").  See the
--   "Diagrams.Located" module for help working with 'Located' values.
--
--   Formally, the semantics of a trail is a continuous (though not
--   necessarily differentiable) function from the real interval [0,1]
--   to vectors in some vector space.  (In contrast, a 'Located' trail
--   is a continuous function from [0,1] to /points/ in some /affine/
--   space.)
--
--   There are two types of trails:
--
--   * A \"line\" (think of the \"train\", \"subway\", or \"bus\"
--     variety, rather than the \"straight\" variety...) is a trail
--     with two distinct endpoints.  Actually, a line can have the
--     same start and end points, but it is still /drawn/ as if it had
--     distinct endpoints: the two endpoints will have the appropriate
--     end caps, and the trail will not be filled.  Lines have a
--     @Monoid@ instance where @mappend@ corresponds to concatenation,
--     /i.e./ chaining one line after the other.
--
--   * A \"loop\" is required to end in the same place it starts (that
--     is, t(0) = t(1)).  Loops are filled and are drawn as one
--     continuous loop, with the appropriate join at the
--     start/endpoint rather than end caps.  Loops do not have a
--     @Monoid@ instance.
--
--   To convert between lines and loops, see 'glueLine',
--   'closeLine', and 'cutLoop'.
--
--   To construct trails, see 'emptyTrail', 'trailFromSegments',
--   'trailFromVertices', 'trailFromOffsets', and friends.  You can
--   also get any type of trail from any function which returns a
--   'TrailLike' (/e.g./ functions in "Diagrams.TwoD.Shapes", and many
--   others; see "Diagrams.TrailLike").
--
--   To extract information from trails, see 'withLine', 'isLoop',
--   'trailSegments', 'trailOffsets', 'trailVertices', and friends.
