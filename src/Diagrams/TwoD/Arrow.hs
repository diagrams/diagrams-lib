{- ~~~~ Note [Default arrow style attributes]
XXX We need to update this note since now an empty lc attribute in
XXX the shaftStyle will default to black in the colorJoint function.
We want to set as few default attributes as possible.  The reason is
that any attributes which get set by default cannot be overridden
later.  For example, if we set 'opacity 1' in shaftStyle, then it
means arrow shafts are always fully opaque (unless you set the opacity
in shaftStyle).  That is, e.g.

  arrowBetween p q # opacity 0.5

will produce exactly the same output as arrowBetween p q, because the
opacity is already set in the arrowBetween call and cannot be
overridden later.

So why set the fill color and line color to black?

  1. The default shaftStyle *must* be set to lc black, because we get
     the joint fill color from the line color set in shaftStyle.  There is
     no way to tell when the user has applied a line color externally to
     the arrow function and magically have the joint fill color update to
     match.  The downside is that the *only* way to change the color of an
     arrow shaft is to modify shaftStyle.  Well, tough luck.

  2. Setting the head and tailStyle to 'id' does not work, because
     then they have the diagrams-default fill, i.e. transparent.

  3. We could set the head and tailStyle using 'recommendFillColor'
     instead of 'fc'.  That way they would be filled black by default
     but could be overridden externally by the user, e.g.

       arrowBetween p q # fc orange

     would change the arrowhead to orange.  However, this just seems
     inconsistent with the fact that # lc orange has no effect (see #1
     above).  So instead we simply set the default head/tail fill with
     'fc' and force the user to override it in the ArrowOpts, just as
     with line color for the shaft.
