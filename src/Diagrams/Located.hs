-- | \"Located\" things, /i.e./ things with a concrete location:
--   intuitively, @Located a ~ (Point, a)@.  Wrapping a translationally
--   invariant thing (/e.g./ a 'Segment' or 'Trail') in 'Located' pins
--   it down to a particular location and makes it no longer
--   translationally invariant.
--
--   @Located@ is intentionally abstract.  To construct @Located@
--   values, use 'at'.  To destruct, use 'viewLoc', 'unLoc', or 'loc'.
--   To map, use 'mapLoc'.
--
--   Much of the utility of having a concrete type for the @Located@
--   concept lies in the type class instances we can give it.  The
--   'HasOrigin', 'Transformable', 'Enveloped', 'Traced', and
--   'TrailLike' instances are particularly useful; see the documented
--   instances below for more information.

infix 5 `at`

-- | Construct a @Located a@ from a value of type @a@ and a location.
--   @at@ is intended to be used infix, like @x \`at\` origin@.
at :: a -> Point (V a) -> Located a
at a p = Loc p a

-- | Deconstruct a @Located a@ into a location and a value of type
--   @a@.  @viewLoc@ can be especially useful in conjunction with the
--   @ViewPatterns@ extension.

-- | 'Located' is not a @Functor@, since changing the type could
--   change the type of the associated vector space, in which case the
--   associated location would no longer have the right type. 'mapLoc'
--   has an extra constraint specifying that the vector space must
--   stay the same.
--
--   (Technically, one can say that for every vector space @v@,
--   @Located@ is a little-f (endo)functor on the category of types
--   with associated vector space @v@; but that is not covered by the
--   standard @Functor@ class.)
